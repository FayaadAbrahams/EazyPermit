# Community Solutions Portal

A web-based portal developed during a 48-hour hackathon hosted by the City of Cape Town. The event brought together randomly selected cross-functional teams to identify and solve a real-world community issue through innovative digital solutions.

Our team was a diverse group consisting of:
- Front-End Developers
- UI/UX Designer
- Business Analysts
- Project Managers

Working collaboratively, we transformed a community problem into a functional prototype within just 48 hours.

## 🚀 Features
